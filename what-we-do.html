        <section class="content-section">
            <p>
                Community Services of Moses Lake (CSML) is a 501 (c) (3) nonprofit organization located in Moses Lake, Washington.
            </p>
            <p>We feed and help those in need.</p>
            <p>We help unite our community.</p>
            <h3>The Moses Lake Food Pantry</h3>
            <p>
                This is just one of the things we do at CSML, and it is an essential component in our mission to help and feed people in need. While our food bank normally provides emergency supplemental food to people on a weekly basis, exceptions are made for the homeless, disaster victims, and other unusual or special situations. Our policy is to give food to everyone who asks for it, and we never charge for food or any other service we offer.
            </p>
            <h3>We Serve Families</h3>
            <p>
                From babies to the elderly, from low-income workers to the unemployed, from single persons to families of 10 or moreâ€”they all have one thing in common: these people cannot afford to buy all the food they need. From July 1st, 2023 to June 30th, 2024, we served food to 33,000 families. More than half of these people receiving food from us are children and seniors.
            </p>

            <h3>Hunger Happens and It Is Real</h3>
            <p>For some, hunger may be the consequence of bad choices. But the truth is, for most, hunger has nothing to do with bad choices. Children have no choice. The handicapped have no choice. The elderly have no choice. And there is no one that ever makes the choice to be hungry.</p>
            <p><strong>Hunger is equal opportunity...</strong> It does not discriminate, it knows no color, no age, no gender, no language, no social standing, no name, no dreams, no hope. And hunger never cares. But we do.</p>
